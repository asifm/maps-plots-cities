<p>The impoverished counties appear to be more inequal. Indeed, there is a moderate inverse correlation between income and inequality, as seen here:</p>
<p><img src="/post/amazon-hq-two-virginias/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="384" /></p>
<p>Across all 3220 counties in the country, the correlation is -0.43, implying inequality is higher in lower income counties.</p>
